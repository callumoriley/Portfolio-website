				<h3>About me</h3>
				<p>I am a third-year electrical engineering (biomedical option) student at the University of British Columbia. I am also a member of UBC Rocket, an engineering design team whose goal it is to design, build, and launch high-power rockets for competitions. I am the electrical lead on the avionics sub-team for the Tantalus and Silvertip rocket projects, doing circuit design, manufacturing, and testing. Outside of school, I have several hobbies, such as working with electronics and programming. I have done numerous projects as part of these hobbies, some of which can be found on this website.</p>
				<br>
				<h3>About the site</h3>
				<p>I created this site over a period of a few months in 2021. It was created using HTML with Bootstrap, which makes the website look cleaner than just a simple HTML site. Bootstrap also makes it responsive, so it works on a wide variety of devices. The site is hosted with GitHub pages, so you can see the repository for the site <a href="https://github.com/callumoriley/Portfolio-website">here</a>. There are a couple Python scripts in the repository whose function is just to make the header and footer of each page the same as the header and footer of index.html, which helps a lot when I want to make a change to the entire site. If you have any questions or comments about the website, please email me.</p>
